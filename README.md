# Advanced Causal Inference Framework for Deep Learning Models via Monte Carlo Integration Methods in Financial Markets

## Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive causal inference framework that bridges the gap between observational data analysis and causal understanding in financial markets. The framework leverages Monte Carlo integration methods to perform backdoor adjustment and estimate treatment effects in the presence of confounding variables, with direct applications to algorithmic trading strategies and market microstructure analysis.

## Research Motivation

Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to capture causal relationships in financial data, leading to spurious correlations and poor out-of-sample performance. This work addresses this limitation by implementing structural causal models (SCMs) that explicitly model the data-generating process, enabling reliable causal inference even in the presence of unobserved confounders.

## Key Contributions

- **Structural Causal Models**: Implementation of SCMs with explicit confounding variable modeling
- **Monte Carlo Integration**: Efficient backdoor adjustment using Monte Carlo methods for treatment effect estimation
- **Intervention Queries**: Framework for counterfactual analysis and "what-if" scenario testing
- **Financial Applications**: Direct applicability to market microstructure analysis and trading strategy development
- **Reproducible Research**: Complete experimental pipeline with synthetic data generation and evaluation metrics

## Technical Implementation

The framework consists of three main components:

1. **SCM Simulation Engine**: Generates synthetic data following specified causal relationships
2. **Monte Carlo Estimator**: Performs backdoor adjustment via Monte Carlo integration
3. **Evaluation Pipeline**: Compares causal estimates against naive observational approaches

## Mathematical Foundation

The core methodology is based on Pearl's causal hierarchy, specifically:
- **Level 1 (Association)**: P(Y|X) - What we observe
- **Level 2 (Intervention)**: P(Y|do(X)) - What happens if we intervene
- **Level 3 (Counterfactuals)**: P(Y_x|X=x', Y=y') - What would have happened

## Applications in Quantitative Finance

- **Strategy Stress Testing**: Evaluate trading strategies under different market conditions
- **Risk Factor Analysis**: Identify causal drivers of portfolio returns
- **Market Microstructure**: Understand causal relationships in high-frequency trading data
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Assess causal impact of regulatory changes on market behavior
